            network packets from the source to the destination. It is involved both at the source host and the

            deliver
            the packet to the data link layer so that it can further be sent to the receiver. At the destination, the
            datagram
            is decapsulated, the packet is extracted and delivered to the corresponding transport layer.

                    Routing and Forwarding –
                    These are two other services offered by the network layer. In a network, there are a number of
                    routes
                    available from the source to the destination. The network layer specifies has some strategies which
                    find
                    out
                    the best possible route. This process is referred to as routing. There are a number of routing
                    protocols
                    which
                    are used in this process and they should be run to help the routers coordinate with each other and
                    help in
                    establishing communication throughout the network.<br>
                    Forwarding is simply defined as the action applied by each router when a packet arrives at one of
                    its
                    interfaces. When a router receives a packet from one of its attached networks, it needs to forward
                    the
                    packet
                    to another attached network (<span class="font-meduim text-yellow-600 underline">unicast routing </span>) or to some attached networks(in case of multicast
                    routing).

                </div>
              </li>
            </ol>

              Some of the other services which are expected from the network layer are:




              Error Control –
              Although it can be implemented in the network layer, but it is usually not preferred because the data
              packet
              in a network layer maybe fragmented at each router, which makes error checking inefficient in the network
              layer.

              Flow Control –
              It regulates the amount of data a source can send without overloading the receiver. If the source produces
              a
              data at a very faster rate than the receiver can consume it, the receiver will be overloaded with data. To
              control the flow of data, the receiver should send a feedback to the sender to inform the latter that it
              is
              overloaded with data.
              There is a lack of flow control in the design of the network layer. It does not directly provide any flow
              control. The datagrams are sent by the sender when they are ready, without any attention to the readiness
              of
              the receiver.


              Congestion Control –
              Congestion occurs when the number of datagrams sent by source is beyond the capacity of network or
              routers.
              This is another issue in the network layer protocol. If congestion continues, sometimes a situation may
              arrive
              where the system collapses and no datagrams are delivered. Although congestion control is indirectly
              implemented in network layer, but still there is a lack of congestion control in the network layer.
              Advantages of Network Layer Services :

              Packetization service in network layer provides an ease of transportation of the data packets.
              Packetization also eliminates single points of failure in data communication systems.
              Routers present in the network layer reduce network traffic by creating collision and broadcast domains.
              With the help of Forwarding, data packets are transferred from one place to another in the network.
              Disadvantages of Network Layer Services :

              There is a lack of flow control in the design of the network layer.
              Congestion occurs sometimes due to the presence of too many datagrams in a network which are beyond the
              capacity of network or the routers. Due to this, some routers may drop some of the datagrams and some
              important piece of information maybe lost.
              Although indirectly error control is present in network layer, but there is a lack of proper error control
              mechanisms as due to presence of fragmented data packets, error control becomes difficult to implement.
